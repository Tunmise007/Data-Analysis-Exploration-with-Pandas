# Data-Analysis-Exploration-with-Pandas
In this project i used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address.

Once I cleaned up the data, I moved to the data exploration section. In this section, I explored five high-level business questions related to our data:

•	What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

•	What city sold the most product?

•	What time should we display advertisements to maximise the likelihood of customers buying products?

•	What products are most often sold together?

•	What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
